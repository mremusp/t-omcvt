/* 206: what is OOP */
/*
Abstraction: ignoring or hiding details that don't matter
Encapsulation: keep properties and methods private inside the class (some can be exposed as API)
Inheritance: Makes all props and methods of a parent class available to a child class
Polymorphism: Child class can overwrite inherited method
*/

/* 207: OOP in JS */
/* 
objects are linked to prototypes, these contain methods which are accesible to the linked objects (prototypal inheritance)
Objects delegate behaviour to the prototype

Constructor functions:
 - create objects from a function
 - how built-in objects like array, maps, sets are implemented
ES6 classes:
 - modern alternative to constructor
 - syntactic sugar: works exactly like constructor
 - do NOT behave like classes in "classical OOP"
Object.create():
 - easiest and most straightforward way of linking an object to a prototype
